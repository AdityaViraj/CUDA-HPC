# CUDA & High-Performance Computing

A deep-dive into **GPU programming and high-performance computing**, focused on writing
**hardware-efficient, production-grade CUDA code**.

## 🎯 Goal
Master GPU programming at a level required for:
- Quantitative finance
- Scientific computing
- ML systems acceleration
- Real-time inference & simulation

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- CUDA kernel design
- Thread hierarchy (grid / block / warp)
- Memory hierarchy (global, shared, constant)
- Memory coalescing & bank conflicts
- CPU ↔ GPU data transfer optimization
- Profiling & benchmarking

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **CUDA C++**
- **NVIDIA Nsight**
- **CMake**
- **Linux**

## 📈 Philosophy
> Hardware awareness is a superpower.

This repo prioritizes **understanding how GPUs actually work**, not just using them.

## 🚀 Roadmap
- [ ] Warp-level primitives
- [ ] Tensor core experiments
- [ ] Multi-GPU (NCCL) basics
- [ ] CUDA acceleration for RL environments
